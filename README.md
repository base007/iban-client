# Iban.com Client

## Documentation

See the [API docs](https://www.iban.com/validation-api-v2.html).


### Requirements

* Ruby 2.0+.

### Bundler

If you are installing via bundler, you should be sure to use the https rubygems
source in your Gemfile, as any gems fetched over http could potentially be
compromised in transit and alter the code of gems fetched securely over https:

``` ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'iban_client'
```
